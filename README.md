# UI component library
This is my first attempt at building a UI library using React, StoryBook, and JSX. 

## Brief
I was given a XD file with 15 UI elements consisting of buttons, text boxes, and icons. The goal was to create these elements using React and Storybook. Here's what that brief looked like:

## Where I'm at
I've built all of the buttons. Each button is functional and deploys features like hover, active, and onClick. I'm proud of accomplishing this much with my very first effort. This is my first time using React so I've learned A LOT and continuing to make progress on building the email form and icon pages. 

## What's next
This will soon be a fully built-out UI component library with UI features found in every front-end project. I'm expecting to complete this soon :)
